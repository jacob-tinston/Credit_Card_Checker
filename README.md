## General info
This project uses Javascript and implementation of the luhn algorithm to take in a card number, validate it and return 'true' if it's valid, 'false' if not, and also returns the company (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) of the card manufacturer.  <br/>
It then returns all of this information to the user via the console.  <br/>
The arrays at the beggining are examples that can be used in the functions to test the program works.

## Technologies
* Coded in Visual Studio Code
* JavaScript
* Luhn algorithm
